# etch-a-sketch
An etch-a-sketch webpage using JavaScript that demonstrates DOM manipulation.

This project will focus on using JavaScript to create square divs that appear as a grid. Each grid will be able to be coloured in like an etch-a-sketch so that a user can draw using their mouse. 

DOM methods will be used to change the colour of the div on hover to give the effect. 

The reset button clears the existing canvas and prompts user to enter a number to create the dimensions of a new grid. 

The rainbow button clears the existing canvas and prompts user to enter a number to create the dimensions of a new grid and changes the solid black fill to a randomized color.
