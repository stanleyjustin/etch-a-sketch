# etch-a-sketch
An etch-a-sketch webpage using JavaScript that demonstrates DOM manipulation.

This project will focus on using JavaScript to create square divs that appear as a grid. Each grid will be able to be coloured in like an etch-a-sketch!
DOM methods will be used to change the colour of the div on hover.
There will be a reset button that will allow a user to choose the denisty of the grid by choosing how many divs per side.
